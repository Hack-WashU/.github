## FAQ
### Why move away from Discord?
Discord is not mature enough as a platform to handle our scheduling and document-sharing needs. While we love the ease of use, it just can't do what we needed to do. Every WashU student already has a Teams account, so we figured that this was the best possible platform to transition to.

### Is Joining Teams and the Outlook Group Really Required to Participate?
Yes! We are doing all of our scheduling and document sharing via Teams and Outlook. Discord events can't be synced with calendars, and we get Teams licenses for free via WashU.
